<p>Solo is the SCCA brand name for autocross competition. Solo events are driving skill contests that emphasize the driver's ability and the car's handling characteristics. This is accomplished by driving a course that is designated by traffic cones on a low hazard location, such as a parking lot or inactive airstrip. While speeds are no greater than those normally encountered in legal highway driving, the combination of concentration and car feedback creates an adrenaline pumping experience. It is like being in a movie chase scene, only you are holding onto the steering wheel instead of a box of popcorn!

<p> <h1>Frequentlly Asked Questions:</h1> 
</p>
<p>Question:<br>
What types of vehicles are elegible to compete?<br>
Answer:<br>
Any car that is in safe, roadworthy condition.  There are a few exceptions:<br>
-Due to their high center of gravity, most trucks and SUV's are not eligible.  Some 2WD pickups, and lowered trucks, will be allowed on a case by case basis.  Please contact the event chairman prior to the event, to avoid disapointment the day of the event.<br>
-Generally our insurance does not allow go-karts.  However, if anybody has an intereset in running a go-kart, we would love to have you at our events.  Just be sure to contact the event chairman well ahead of the event, so we can get the site approved and the insurance updated. <br>
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Question:<br>
What type of hemet do I need?<br>
Answer:<br>
Any recent Snell approved helment (S2000, M2000, S2005, M2005, S2010, M2010).  Helmets with just a DOT approval are not allowed.  If you do not have a helmet, we do have several loaners available at the event. </p>
<p></p>

<p>Question:<br>
I am concerned that my vehicle will not pass the technical inspection.  What are you looking for?<br>
Answer:<br>
As long as your vehcile is in safe condition we will let you run.  Here is a link to the inspection sheet that we use.  If you have any concerns contact the event chair, perhaps we can arrainge a "pre-inspection" with a memeber in your area before the event.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Question:<br>
What do I need to do before and the day of the event?<br>
Answer:<br>
-Figure out you vehicle class before the event.  The people working the registration table have alot going on and may not be framiliar with the class you be in.  Ultimatlly it is the responsibility of the driver to determine what class thier car should be in.  Everybody is usually pretty laid back about honest classing mistakes.  If you think someone might bring it to thier/our attention before the awards are handed out.<br>
-Please register on-line, this saves you $10, and helps makes things run smoother the day of the event for everybody.  On-line registration usually closes the Friday before the event.  Please see the event listing for details.<br>
-Arrive on time.  We are always looking for help setting up a few last minute things the day of the event.  You will also need some time to prepare your vehicle and walk the course.<br>
-Stop by the registration desk.  If you registered on-line, pick up your inspection sheet.  If you did not register on-line there will be some paperwork to fill out and you will need to pay the entrance fee.<br>
-Put your inspection form under your windshield whiper and prepare your vehicle for the inspection.  This means:  Remove all loose items from your car, like floor mats, cell phones, jumper cable, or anything else that might become airborne.<br>
-Make sure your tires are properlly inflated.<br>
-Walk the course.  We sometimes do a novice walk, but not always.  If you have any questions about the course feel free to ask.
-Offer to help out.  If you have some extra time before the drivers meeting, ask the event chair if there is anything you can do to help out.  This will help keep the event on time and allow everybody to go home on time.
-Keep an eye on the clock.  Please be at the registration table for the drivers meeting.  It usually starts at 10:00, but check the schedule for details.<br>
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Question:<br>
How are the events structured?<br>
Answer:<br>
-We split all the drivers into two groups (A and B).  When the "A" group is driving the "B" group is working the course.<br>
-Depending on the site we will have a "rolling grid" or "standing grid".  The event chair will discuss this during the drivers meeting.<br>
-After the "A" group has run 3 times.  The "B" group drives and the "A" group workes.  It is imparative that all drivers report for their working duties.<br>
-After both groups have run we usally take lunch.  The event chair will anounce when the event will resume after lunch.  Please be back and ready to run at that time.<br>
-After both groups have run again, we will tear down the course and back it into the trailer.  We will need some help with this so offer to lend a hand.<br>
-While the trailer is being packed, times will be calculated and posted.  If you have any questions or concerns about your times, please bring them up.<br>
-Awards will be handed out.
-Evreybody goes home happy:)</p>
<p></p>

<p>Question:<br>
What should I keep in mind during the event?<br>
Answer:<br>
-Keep an eye out for safety concerns.  Any issues, or potential issues, should be brought to the attention of the event chair or Safety Steward.<br>
-Don't crowd the starting line.  If you are next in line for the start stay back a respectiable distance.  Some rear wheel drive cars shoot out dirt and gravel when they launch.  This can damage your paint.  Also, if the dirver at the start has his car in reverse rather than forward, this will damage much more than your paint.<br>
-When you are at the start, make sure you know where your wheels are pointing.  It is possible you think your wheels are pointing straight ahead, but in reality the steering wheel is one rotation off from center.<br>
