Any novice should have no problem finding their way.  TSD, a form of RoadRally, stands for Time, Speed and Distance.  In TSD any car will work as long as it is licensed and road worthy.  TSD’s are run on Public Roads at legal speeds, you are given instructions on where to go and average speeds you are to maintain.  The winner is the one who can not only get to the right place but also get there at the right time.  Accuracy, not speed is the key.  Come for a drive and share in an evening of Rally stories, they seem to get better each time they’re told.
